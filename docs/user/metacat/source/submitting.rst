Accessing and Submitting Metadata and Data
==========================================

Your Metacat repository and its respective metadata and data objects can be accessed through
``metacatui``, which is a client-side web interface for querying Metacat servers (and other servers
that implement the DataONE REST API). The web submission form in ``metacatui`` is the suggested method
for initial submissions to your metacat repository.

Getting Started
--------------------------------------------

To begin submitting data, navigate to ``metacatui`` in your internet browser at:
  http://<yourhost.org>/metacatui

Then click 'Sign in' in the upper right hand corner. To sign in, you will need an ``ORCID``.
If you do not have one, you can sign up here:
  https://orcid.org/

Once you've signed in, move your cursor to the upper right-hand corner and hover above your name,
this will reveal a drop down menu. Click 'Submit Data', and add your data and metadata documents.

Alternatively, you may use the DataONE REST API to submit and access data and metadata.
