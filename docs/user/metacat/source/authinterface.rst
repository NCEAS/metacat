Metacat Authentication Mechanism
================================

Metacat only supports ORCID authentication for administrative users. File-based or LDAP
authentication is no longer available. Registering for an ORCID is simple, please visit:

  http://orcid.org/

After signing up for an ORCID iD, you may use it as an admin identity when first configuring Metacat
authentication settings. Note, your full ORCID iD includes `https://orcid.org/` not just the 16-digit
ORCID iD:
  ex. http://orcid.org/0000-0001-2345-6789

This ORCID iD provides admin privileges and authorization to all Metacat features.
