  * This DTD describes the structure and content of XML documents used
  * to represent, store, and exchange a simple path-based query expression.
  * This syntax represents a small subset of the capabilities of the XPath 
  * language (http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath), and is intended as a simple
  * query language for the metadata catalog database (mcdb).  It is 
  * intended that all expressions in this language can be mapped directly
  * into XPath syntax, but not all Xpath expressions can be mapped into this
  * syntax.
  *
  * Although ideally we would implement the query language as either the full
  * XPath language or as one of the emerging XML query languages (like
  * XML-QL or XQL), in practice this would be an involved undertaking that
  * doesn't necessarily have high payoffs.  But we will revisit this issue and
  * determine later whether these full-featured technologies are warranted
  * after we have some experience with a simpler implementation such as this.
