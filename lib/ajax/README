Setup
-----
1) Make sure you have the google web toolkit installed.  You can get it from 
http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/.  From now on, I will refer to the google 
web toolkit directory as the "gwt" directory.
2) Make a symbolic link in the gwt directory so that 
gwt-dev.jar -> gwt-dev-xxx.jar where xxx is either "mac", "linux" or "windows".
This just makes the scripting easier to deal with.
3) Edit the KeplerClient-shell file and make sure $GWT points to your 
gwt installation.  Do the same for KeplerClient-compile

Building
--------
Run the KeplerClient-shell script.  Upon successful compilation, you should 
see two windows open.  One is the tomcat server shell, the other is a test 
browser where you will see the web page.  

Testing
-------
You can use the -shell file for incremental building and testing.  If you want 
to "clean" the project, you can use the ant build.xml file.  The build file 
really is not needed.

Installation/Deployment
-----------------------
Once you have a working product and you want to deploy to a normal instance 
of Tomcat, you can first test that your code works under a normal browser by 
clicking the "compile/test" button on the google browser.  This will open your 
page in whatever your default browswer is.  Your server side code is still 
running on the google tomcat instance (port 8888).  If you want to deploy the 
servlet and client side code to another instance of Tomcat, follow the 
instructions in the INSTALL file.

A note on using different OSs
-----------------------------
There are a few differences when moving between windows, linux and osx.  
On OSX, the -XstartOnFirstThread flag must be set in the KeplerClient-shell 
and KeplerClient-compile scripts.  Also, make sure you make a symlink for the 
gwt-dev jar file.  For some reason, google renames this jar depending on what 
system you download gwt for.
