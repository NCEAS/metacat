This file covers deploying the gwt created ajax code and servlet to a non-google
version of tomcat.  This allows for the installation of the servlet(s) along 
side a normal metacat installation.  This file assumes you've already done 
the steps highlighted in the README file.

1) Create a servlet on your tomcat instance called "rpc".  This is a simple 
servlet that just runs the google remote procedure call (rpc) services.  Use 
the web.xml file from the ./tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF directory.  You'll 
also need to copy all of the gwt jar files from your gwt installation as well 
as all of the jar files in ./lib.  Use the gwt-user.jar and gwt-dev.jar from 
metacat/lib.  If you use the ones from the gwt distro, tomcat won't load them
due to the presence of javax.servlet.Servlet.

2) copy ./src/org/kepler/web/service/KeplerServiceServlet.java to 
metacat/src/org/kepler/web/service/ and update the KeplerServiceServlet.java 
Edit the file with the correct url to your metacat servlet (line 6 in the code).  
Make sure the moduleRelativeURL exactly matches the url that will be browsed
to!  I.E. Don't use "localhost" if you intend to browse to an actual machine
name.  This confuses the RPC and will cause problems.  

3) Copy the lib/gwt-*.jar files to metacat/lib.  Note this may cause some 
problems with jsp compilation.

4) run 'ant package' (from the ajax dir) and copy the newly created 
kepler-web.jar file to metacat/lib/.  Make sure you updated the hard coded
servlet paths in the java code before doing this.

5) run 'ant install' from your metacat directory

6) make sure tomcat restarts

7) run ./KeplerClient-compile and copy the contents of the www directory 
to some web accessible location, then browse to the KeplerClient.html file 
and the javascript should run.  

--------------------------------
If this doesn't work for some reason, keep in mind the main things you need.  
They are:
* the rpc servlet
* the KeplerServiceServlet servlet.  In the web.xml file, I have called this 
  'gwt' so the address will be: http://server:8080/servletpath/gwt
* the compiled javascript (ajax) code
* hard coded server/servlet paths correctly changed
* all jar files accessible to tomcat
