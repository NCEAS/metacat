<abstract>
<para>Seasonal patterns of estuarine creek-bank and intertidal marsh benthic chlorophyll, density, porosity, and organic content were investigated at several sites on Sapelo Island and the Satilla River in coastal Georgia.  Benthic chlorophyll, density, porosity, and organic content were measured in the bulk surface centimeter depth of sediment.  Several relatively pristine sites on Sapelo Island (Moses Hammock and Dean Creek) and a presumably heavily impacted site (Dover Bluff) show similar levels of chlorophyll concentration across bank and marsh zones with higher photosynthetic biomass in the spring season.</para>

<geographicDescription>GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse.  A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity  and  genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu)</geographicDescription>

<abstract>
<para>We propose to establish a Long Term Ecological Research site on the central Georgia coast in the vicinity of Sapelo Island. This is a barrier island and marsh complex with the Altamaha River, one of the largest and least developed rivers on the east coast of the US, as the primary source of fresh water. The proposed study would investigate the linkages between local and distant upland areas mediated by water - surface water and ground water - delivery to the coastal zone. We would explicitly examine the relationship between variability in environmental factors driven by river flow, primarily salinity because we can measure it at high frequency, and ecosystem processes and structure. We will accomplish this by comparing estuary/marsh complexes separated from the Altamaha River by one or two lagoonal estuary/marsh complexes that damp and attenuate the river signal. This spatial gradient is analogous to the temporal trend in riverine influence expected as a result of development in the watershed. We will implement a monitoring system that documents physical and biological variables and use the time trends and spatial distributions of these variables and of their variance structure to address questions about the factors controlling distributions, trophic structure, diversity, and biogeochemistry. An existing GIS-based hydrologic model will be modified to incorporate changes in river water resulting from changes in land use patterns that can be expected as the watershed develops. This model will be linked to ecosystem models and will serve as an heuristic and management tool. Another consequence of coastal development is that as river flow decreases, groundwater flow increases and becomes nutrified. We will compare the effects of ground water discharge from the surficial aquifer in relatively pristine (Sapelo Island) versus more urbanized (mainland) sites to assess the relative importance of fresh water versus nutrients to productivity, structure and biomass turnover rate in marshes influenced by groundwater. We will also investigate the effect of marine processes (tides, storm surge) on mixing across the fresh/salt interface in the surficial aquifer. Additional physical studies will relate the morphology of salt marsh - tidal creek channel complexes to tidal current distributions and exchange. These findings will be incorporated into a physical model that will be coupled to an existing ecosystem model. The land/ocean margin ecosystem lies at the interface between two ecosystems in which distinctly different groups of decomposers control organic matter degradation. The terrestrial ecosystem is largely dominated by fungal decomposers, while bacterial decomposers dominate the marine ecosystem. Both groups are important in salt marsh-dominated ecosystems. Specific studies will examine, at the level of individual cells and hyphae, the relationship bacteria and fungi in the consortia that decompose standing dead Spartina and other marsh plants and examine how, or if, this changes along the salinity gradient.</para>

<para>The GCE Data Toolbox is a comprehensive library of functions for metadata-based analysis, visualization, transformation and management of ecological data sets. The toolbox is based on the GCE Data Structure specification, a standard for storing tabular data along with all information required to interpret the data and generate formatted metadata (documentation).  The various metadata fields in the structure are queried by toolbox functions for all operations, allowing functions to process and format values appropriately based on the type of information they represent. This semantic processing approach supports highly automated and intelligent data analysis and ensures data set validity throughout all processing steps.</para>
