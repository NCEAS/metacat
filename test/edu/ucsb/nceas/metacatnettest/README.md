# Use the `test/edu/ucsb/nceas/metacatnettest` directory only for tests that require a running metacat instance

(e.g. to test networking and replication functionality)

For unit and integration tests that do NOT require metacat to be running, use the `test/edu/ucsb/nceas/metacat` test directory.

NOTE there may currently be tests in the wrong location. Feel free to move them.
