# Use the `test/edu/ucsb/nceas/metacat` directory only for unit tests and integration tests that do NOT require metacat to be running

For tests that need a running metacat instance, and test networking and replication functionality, use `test/edu/ucsb/nceas/metacatnettest`

NOTE there may currently be tests in the wrong location. Feel free to move them.
