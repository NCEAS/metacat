This directory has two script files to backup/restore the checksums table from a Metacat instance
database.

To backup the table, you need to run this command:
./backup-checksums-table.sh  <databaseName> <<backupDirectory>
It will copy the records in the checksums table to a file named checksums-backup.txt in the backup
directory. The backup directory should exist and the backup file will be overwritten if it exists.

To restore the table, you need to run this command:
./restore-checksums-table.sh <databaseName> <backupFilePath>
Before run this command, make sure the checksums table is empty. Otherwise, the records will be
duplicated.
