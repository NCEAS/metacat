Metacat.pm -- perl client to the Metacat XML database
-----------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.0 Alpha 1 Release

Feedback and bugs - please create a GitHub Issue: https://github.com/NCEAS/metacat/issues/new

This is a Metacat Client library that allows access to Metacat, a flexible 
database storage system for XML formatted documents. The client library
provides facilities for inserting, updating, and deleting XML documents
from metacat, as well as querying metacat using the Metacat pathquery 
query syntax.

INSTALLATION
------------
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

If you want the tests to work, you'll need to edit the metacatUrl, username,
and password parameters in the test script and set them to real values for
a working Metacat database.

USAGE
-----
Use "perldoc Metacat" after installation for detailed documentation.

Details of the Metacat architecture can be found on the website for 
the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB):
