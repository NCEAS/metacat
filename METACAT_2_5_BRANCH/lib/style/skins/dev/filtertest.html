For the test database, some valid values for the search that produce document
results include "Value1" and "lakename" and maybe "122W"
<p>
To view results that are XML formatted in this demo, it is easiest to use 
Internet Explorer 5. Although Netscape browsers will allow you to 
download XML documents, only IE5 will display XML at this time.
