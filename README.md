Metacat is repository software for preserving data and metadata
(documentation about data) that helps scientists find, understand and
effectively use data sets they manage or that have been created by
others. Hundreds of thousands of data sets are currently documented in
a standardized way and stored in Metacat systems, providing the
scientific community with a broad range of science data that can be
easily searched, compared, merged, or used in other ways because the
data are well and consistently described.

## Installation
See [installation notes](./docs/user/metacat/source/install.rst) for detailed instructions for your OS.

## Documentation
See the docs directory for detailed documentation and installation
instructions.

Details of the Metacat architecture can be found on the website for
the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB):
